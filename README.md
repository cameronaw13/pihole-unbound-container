# cameronaw13's Pihole Unbound container

### ⚠ This image is made solely for my own homelab setup, breaking changes can occur! ⚠

This forked was made to continue the work of [chriscrowe's pihole-unbound repo](https://github.com/chriscrowe/docker-pihole-unbound) with the addition of (almost) automatic dependabot updates.

In this repo, all images are built and pushed to the github container registry rather than dockerhub for ease of use.

Small parts of the workflows were based off of [origamiofficial's repo](https://github.com/origamiofficial/docker-pihole-unbound/tree/main), I recommend using their image if you want more support.

## Original Description

This Docker deployment runs both Pi-Hole and Unbound in a single container.

The base image for the container is the [official Pi-Hole container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole), with an extra build step added to install the Unbound resolver directly into to the container based on [instructions provided directly by the Pi-Hole team](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/).

## Usage

First create a `.env` file to substitute variables for your deployment.

### Pi-hole environment variables

> Vars and descriptions replicated from the [official pihole container](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#environment-variables):

| Variable | Default | Value | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `TZ` | UTC | `<Timezone>` | Set your [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to make sure logs rotate at local midnight instead of at UTC midnight.
| `WEBPASSWORD` | random | `<Admin password>` | http://pi.hole/admin password. Run `docker logs pihole \| grep random` to find your random pass.
| `FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4` | unset | `<Host's IP>` | Set to your server's LAN IP, used by web block modes and lighttpd bind address.
| `REV_SERVER` | `false` | `<"true"\|"false">` | Enable DNS conditional forwarding for device name resolution |
| `REV_SERVER_DOMAIN` | unset | Network Domain | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the domain of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_TARGET` | unset | Router's IP | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the IP of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_CIDR` | unset | Reverse DNS | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the reverse DNS zone (e.g. `192.168.0.0/24`) |
| `WEBTHEME` | `default-light` | `<"default-dark"\|"default-darker"\|"default-light"\|"default-auto"\|"lcars">`| User interface theme to use.

Example `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```
FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4=192.168.1.10
TZ=America/Los_Angeles
WEBPASSWORD=QWERTY123456asdfASDF
REV_SERVER=true
REV_SERVER_DOMAIN=local
REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.1
REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.0.0/16
HOSTNAME=pihole
DOMAIN_NAME=pihole.local
PIHOLE_WEBPORT=80
WEBTHEME=default-light
```

### Running the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> If using Portainer, just paste the `docker-compose.yaml` contents into the stack config and add your *environment variables* directly in the UI.
